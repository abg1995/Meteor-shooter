##Meteor Shooter

This is my game project for week 3: Meteor shooter. Here we have a game with controls awsd for the movement and Spacebar for shooting. Not yet implememnted but, after a certain number of points you get to pass to the next level. If you crash with one of the meteors, you are out of the game! You w ill be directed to a loser page where you can press the button to try again.

Things i didnt get to add in this game due to time:

-lifes

-music

-more levels

-timer
